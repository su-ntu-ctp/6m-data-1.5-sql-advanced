**Theme:** From Tables to Intelligence — joining, ranking, and structuring complex queries

---

## 📅 Lesson Overview

| Section | Duration | Topic / Activity |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| **Part 1: Joins & Unions** | 55 min | INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL JOIN; UNION; multi-table reporting |

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

1. **Execute** INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL OUTER JOINs to combine data across multiple tables.
2. **Apply** Window Functions (`SUM OVER`, `RANK OVER`) to compute running totals and rankings without losing row-level detail.
3. **Write** Subqueries using `IN`, `EXISTS`, and derived tables to filter results based on aggregated logic.
4. **Structure** complex analytical queries using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for readability and reuse.
